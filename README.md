In this project, we’re developing a model that can recognize emotions based on facial expressions 
and classify them into specific categories. The dataset we’re using consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale 
images of faces, each centered and aligned to ensure uniformity. The task is to identify the 
emotion being expressed in the image and classify it into one of seven emotions. The dataset 
includes over 28,000 training images and around 3,500 test images, giving us a good amount of 
data to work with.

Our main goal is to build a model that can accurately detect emotions from facial expressions and 
classify them into one of the following categories:   
1. Angry   
2. Disgust   
3. Fear   
4. Happy   
5. Sad   
6. Surprise   
7. Neutral
